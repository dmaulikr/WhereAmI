The main purpose of this app is to equip the user with information about his/her location in the Columbia University morningside heights campus. The application enables a user to click a photograph of a nearby building and then exploits a computer vision algorithm to identify the building informing the user about the location on campus. The application also has the ability to dexterously provide web based metadata about the recognized building in a user friendly manner. On the backend, we utilize computer vision algorithms like SIFT keypoint detector and descriptor to extract features and form a bag-of-words model to retrieve the closest match of the image in the existing database.
